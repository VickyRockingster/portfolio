            <h3><a href="https://vickyrockingster.github.io/scribe">Scribe</a></h3>
            <p class="project-description">Scribe is a single-page-application
              that allows users to write journal entries in an online application.
              Once signed in, users can create, edit, and delete any of their
              entries.</br>
              I created this application because I find journaling to be great for
              relaxing and processing at the end of the day. I wanted to create an
              application that would allow me to do that. For that reason, Scribe
              only has two resources: users and (journal) entries, with a
              one-to-many relationship, respectively. <br/>
              However, I put more thought into choosing the technology stack for
              this project. Originally, I thought to build the back-end with a Rails api
              and a non-relational database like MongoDB. Since users are only meant to have
              access to their own entries, it made since for each user to be a
              document in a collection. However, I figured that even if journaling is the
              intended usage of this app, it wouldn't be out of the question to use
              it to take notes, write books, or engage in any writing activity
              that could potentially require building out relationships beyond user
              and journal entry. For that reason, I decided to use a relational
              PostgreSQL database instead. <br/>
              As for the front-end, Scribe is the first project I created using React.js.
              I really wanted to explore more front-end JavaScript frameworks
              because they utilize a completely different system of organization, and
              I wanted to challenge myself to learn more about different kinds of
              web tools that can accomplish the same goal using wildly different
              tools, technologies, and methods. Moving from JavaScript and jQuery
              to React.js definitely had a steep learning curve, but React.js has
              a lot of object-oriented methodology, so I got the hang of it within
              a few days. I'm really glad that I used Raect.js, because I gained a
              lot of insight into object-oriented programming, especially in using
              inheritance and composition to build out an application.

            <h3><a href="https://vickyrockingster.github.io/list-note-project-front-end/">
              ListNote</a></h3>
            <p class="project-description">ListNote is a single-page application
              that allows users to create to-do lists. This application
              differentiates between different kinds of to-do lists : A 'chores'
              to-do list, in which allows users  list all the things they need to
              do around the house (e.g. do laundry); an 'errands' to-do list, in
              which users list all the things they need to do outside the house
              (e.g. pick up dry-cleaning); and a 'to-get' list, in which users can
              list all the things they need to get (e.g. groceries to buy).<br/>
              I was inspired to create this application because I love making
              lists, but I've had some frustration in not having access to an
              application that differentiated between the different kinds of
              to-do lists I'd use. ListNote is meant to address that use case.<br/>
              I plan to build out features that would allow signed-in users to share lists,
              as well as create their own (e.g. two roommates sharing a grocery
              to-get list, or two fiancees sharing a wedding errand list). This
              would require some re-factoring to create a many-to-many relationship
              between the user and each of the other resources (i.e. errands, chores,
              and to-gets) in the back-end, as well as building out that
              functionality in the front-end. I would also like to build a second
              front-end using the React framework, both to practice my skills and
              to explore different ways of styling.

            <p class="project-description">
              A bucket list contains all the experiences that a person hopes to
              have during their lifetime. This application is a tool for people to
              manage that list. Bucket List is a single-page application where
              each user can create, read, update and delete items from their
              bucket list.<br/>
              Bucket List was a group project. While working on this project, I
              really learned a lot. @AllanOlive, who I pair-programmed with for a lot of
              this, really helped me to understand modals, as well as how to better
              code collaboratively. I am very proud of how much my team was able
              to do in the three says that we worked on this app.<br/>
              However, I do plan to re-factor and re-style both the back-end and
              front-end. I want to spend more time honing my skills with Express.js,
              and with styling.

              Tic-Tac-Toe</a></h3>
            <p class="project-description">
              Tic-tac-toe is single-page application that allows users to sign in,
              play Tic-Tac-Toe, and access their game statistics.<br/>
              Tic-Tac-Toe was the very first developer project I completed. I decided not
              to re-write it so I can track my growth as a developer over time.
              Even though I may look back on it one day and cringe at the styling
              or the smelly code, I will always remember that feeling of pride
              when I fully completed it.<br/>
              However, I do plan to create another Tic-Tac-Toe front-end that is
              re-styled and re-factored. It will allow me to do a direct
              comparision between projects to measure my growth in this field, and
              I think continuous progress will always be an important part of my
              work as a developer.
