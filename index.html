                  I find journaling to be great for relaxing and processing at
                  the end of the day, so I wanted to create an application
                  that would allow me to do that online. Scribe is a
                  single-page-application that allows users to write journal
                  entries in an online application.</br>
                  In the back-end, I thought to use a Rails api with a
                  non-relational database.
                  <!-- Since users are only meant to have
                  access to their own entries, it made sense for each user to
                  be a document in a collection. -->
                  However, I figured that this app could potentially be used
                  to take notes, write books, or otherwise engage in a writing
                  activity that would require building out relationships
                  beyond user and journal entries. For that reason, I decided
                  to use the relational database PostgreSQL instead.<br/>
                  As for the front-end, I used React.js. I wanted to challenge
                  myself to learn more about different kinds of web tools that
                  can accomplish the same goal using different technologies
                  and methods than the JavaScript and jQuery I was used to.
                  <!-- Moving from JavaScript and jQuery
                  to React.js definitely had a steep learning curve, but React.js has
                  a lot of object-oriented methodology, sond I will always remember that feeling of pride when I completed it.
                  However, I decided not to re-make it. I think continuous progress is an integral p I got the hang of it within
                  a few days. I'm also really glad that I used React.js, because I gained a
                  lot of insight into object-oriented programming. -->

                  I created ListNote because I love making
                  lists, but I've had some frustration in not finding  an
                  application that differentiated between different kinds
                  of to-do lists. ListNote is a single-page application that
                  addresses that issue.<br/>
                  Users can create a 'chores' to-do list, that lists all
                  the things the user needs to do around the house (e.g. do
                  laundry), or an 'errands' to-do list, that lists all the
                  things the user needs to do outside the house (e.g. pick up
                  dry-cleaning).<br/>
                  <!-- and a 'to-get' list, that lists all the the user needs
                  to get (e.g. bread in a groceries list).<br/> -->
                  Moving forward, I plan to build out features that would
                  allow signed-in users to share lists, as well as create
                  their own. This would require some re-factoring to create a
                  many-to-many relationship between the user and each of the
                  other resources (i.e. errands, chores) in the back-end, as
                  well as building out that functionality in the front-end.
                  <!-- I would also like to build a second
                  front-end using the React framework, both to practice my skills and
                  to explore different ways of styling. -->

                  Bucket List is a single-page application in which users can
                  create, get, edit and delete items from their bucket list.<br/>
                  Bucket List was my first group development project. I learned
                  a lot about co-operative programming while working on this
                  project, especially agile development and co-operative
                  programming (pair programming, mob programming, etc).<br/>
                  Most importantly, this project taught me a lot about the
                  importance of consistent communication and support between
                  team members. Everything, from coding to wireframing, was done
                  collaboratively. For that reason, my team was able to
                  accomplish so much in just three days, and I am very proud of
                  that. <br/>
                  Moving forward, I do plan to re-factor and re-style both the
                  back-end and front-endrepos of course, in different , so I can
                  spend more time honing my skills with Express.js and Bootstrap.
                  <!-- After we completed our team project, I did re-factor and
                  re-style both the back-end and front-end on separate repos. I
                  wanted to develop my skills with Express.js and Bootstrap.

                  Tic-tac-toe is single-page application that allows users to
                  sign in, play Tic-Tac-Toe, and access their game statistics.
                  It was the very first development project I finished, and I
                  will always remember that feeling of pride when I completed
                  it.<br/>
                  However, I decided not to re-make this project. I think
                  continuous progress is an integral part of the work of any
                  developer, and I want my work with this project to be a direct
                  reflection of that. Instead, I plan to create a second
                  Tic-Tac-Toe front-end that is re-styled and re-factored. That
                  way, I can make a direct comparision between the two sites and
                  track my growth as a developer. <br/>

                  <!-- In order to track my progress, I decided to leave my original finished,
                  and make any improvements in a new repo. The  image above links to
                  the revised version, but this is the link to my original project:
